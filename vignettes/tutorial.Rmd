# Introduction

This R package is a compilation of various statistical functions that I wrote for my Statistics 302 class at the University of Washington. 

Install this package using the following code:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("dhruvrc/STAT302Package")
```


```{r setup}
library(STAT302Package)
```
